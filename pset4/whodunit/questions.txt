1.  stdint.h is a header file in the C standard library that allows us to provide a set of typedefs that specify exact-width integer
    types, together with the defined minimum and maximum allowable values for each type, using macros.
2.  using those integer types we can define integers with a width of exactly 8, 32 and 16 bit. 'uint' makes reference to unsigned
    integer and 'int' to signed integer.
3.  1, 4, 4 and 2 bytes.
4.  'BM' (0x42 0x4D).
5.  biSize is the size of the BITMAPINFOHEADER, it's always 40 bytes. bfSize is the size of the whole file which consists of the
    image itself (non-fixed value), the BITMAPINFOHEADER (40 bytes) and the BITMAPFILEHEADER (14 bytes).
6.  if biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down device-independent bitmap (rgb-pixel table) with the origin at the upper left
    corner.
7.  biBitCount.
8.  in line 24 it might return null if the file doesn't exist in that directory, in line 32 it might if the user who is running the
    program hasn't got permission to create or modify files.
9.  because we want to read a single element BITMAPFILEHEADER on the first call and BITMAPINFOHEADER on the second one.
10. 3.
11. fseek keeps track of where in the file we are. in copy.c line 84 it moves 'padding' bytes forward.
12. SEEK_CUR is the current cursor position in the file.
